# Projects Directory

This directory is where you can add your own sub-projects. Each project should be in its own folder.

## How to add a new project

1.  **Create a folder**: Create a new folder inside this `projects` directory. For example, `my-app`.
2.  **Add content**: Inside your new folder (`projects/my-app`), create an `index.html` file. This will be the entry point for your project.
3.  **Add assets**: You can add CSS, JavaScript, and images directly in your project folder or in a `public` subfolder (e.g., `projects/my-app/public/style.css`).
4.  **Access**: Your project will be automatically served at `/projects/YOUR_FOLDER_NAME/`.
    *   Example: `/projects/my-app/`

## Sample Project

A sample project is included in the `sample-project` folder. You can view it at `/projects/sample-project/`.
It demonstrates:
*   HTML structure
*   CSS styling
*   JavaScript interaction
